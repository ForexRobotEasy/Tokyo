Welcome to the ReadMe file for Tokyo Forex Software, developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. This software is designed for multi-symbol trading and aims to provide accurate trading decisions based on the trained neural network.

## How It Works

### GetSymbolPrice(symbol)

This function retrieves the current price for a given symbol. The code logic inside this function implements the necessary steps to fetch the current price. The function then returns the current price.

### NormalizePrice(price, period)

The NormalizePrice function normalizes the price using the 'sliding' algorithm. The algorithm logic is implemented within this function. The function takes the price and a period as input and returns the normalized price.

### TrainNeuralNetwork()

The TrainNeuralNetwork function is responsible for training the recurrent neural network using historical data. The code logic inside this function performs the necessary steps to train the neural network.

### MakeTradingDecisions()

The MakeTradingDecisions function utilizes the trained neural network to make trading decisions. The logic inside this function implements the necessary steps to make trading decisions based on the trained neural network.

### start()

The main function for the Tokyo trading robot. It begins by setting the desired symbols to trade, which are 'AUDUSD', 'EURUSD', 'GBPUSD', 'USDCAD', 'USDCHF', and 'USDJPY'. 

The code then loops through each symbol, retrieves the current price using the GetSymbolPrice function, normalizes the price using the NormalizePrice function, and makes trading decisions based on the normalized price. If the normalized price is positive, the program buys the symbol. If it is negative, the program sells the symbol. Otherwise, it does nothing.

After looping through all symbols, the neural network is trained using the TrainNeuralNetwork function, and trading decisions are made using the MakeTradingDecisions function.

## Product Description

Tokyo Forex Software is a powerful tool developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to provide multi-symbol trading capabilities, allowing users to trade a variety of currency pairs simultaneously.

With Tokyo Forex Software, you can automate your trading decisions using a trained neural network. The software retrieves the current prices for the selected symbols and normalizes them using an advanced 'sliding' algorithm. Based on the normalized prices, the software makes informed trading decisions, either buying or selling the symbols.

Tokyo Forex Software is built on cutting-edge technology, providing accurate and reliable trading signals. The neural network is trained using historical data, ensuring that it can adapt to market conditions and make profitable trades.
